Mycelium 3D Depth network computational array - Ver 0.1 - Extremely rough draft/idea I came up for funsies.

My idea is a Cube, or other third dimensional shape of soil or other similar substrate which contains a mycelium network throughout. In order to gather information and communicate with this network, electrodes coated in carbon nano tubes
or gold to prevent corrosion are inserted at varying depths (Thousands of electrodes would be necessary, likely in the 100s of thousands or more) these electrodes can then detect a full network of mycelium allowing for much richer data
and density than previously seen.

In order to keep the substrate together, a mesh or similar substance could coat the entire object/cube/third dimensional mycelium network, this would allow for the electrodes to be probed into the mycelium network while keeping the 
structure intact. 

I will also include my incredible drawing skills for demonstration and visual aid, I chose a cube as that is a stable shape for substrate outside of the ground.
